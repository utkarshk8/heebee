          <p className="about_content">
            The owners of HeeBee Nitigya Soni and Gavish Batra are die-hard
            coffee lovers. They always preferred making their own coffee rather
            than buying it from the famous coffee shops in town. Because of
            their passion for coffee, they were the permanent hosts of any
            get-together. Their coffee was so popular among their group that
            their friends started inviting non-mutual friends to their place for
            coffee. That is when everyone suggested them to open their own café.
            They pondered over the idea for a while and started research on
            coffee and thus opened a café that is serving you best coffee in
            town.

            WHY <q>HEEBEE</q>?
          </h3>
          <p className="about_content">
            HeeBee is a result of the past two years of research, experimenting,
            and tasting. The owners admit that coming up with a name was a
            difficult and easy process at the same time. They had been thinking
            of a name that is striking and matched their moto of café. One day
            after pondering over a name for a month, they were sitting in a
            park, when they observed a beehive. They both started discussing
            over how bees were solely dedicated to one thing all their life-
            producing honey and how the cells of a beehive were all intact and
            connected without a single space in between them. It was then it
            struck both of them to include bee in their name as it would go with
            the moto of consistency, quality, and loyalty. So Bee was included
            and Hee just tagged along. In owners’ words ‘We are loyal like a bee
            but towards coffee. We are intact as a beehive because we take our
            customers, employees, and everyone connected to us along because we
            are who we are only because of them.
